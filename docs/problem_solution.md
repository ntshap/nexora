# Problem & Solution

## Background

Creative professionals—musicians, designers, digital artists—often earn in irregular bursts from many channels. Traditional finance products frequently ignore this reality, while DeFi tooling assumes significant technical knowledge. Result: creatives either keep assets idle, or they entrust funds to opaque custodial apps.

## Problem Statement

- High cognitive load to evaluate DeFi protocols and yield options.
- Fear of losing custody due to wallet mismanagement or custodial lock-in.
- Lack of contextualised analytics to explain risk/return in plain language.

## NEXORA Solution

1. **Personalised, rule-based plans** generated from a simple risk form, returning a Conservative, Balanced, and Growth strategy.
2. **Non-custodial ERC‑4626 vaults** that preserve user ownership—no keys ever leave the wallet.
3. **Transparent analytics dashboard** that reads on-chain balances and translates them into intuitive metrics for creatives.

## Key Differentiators

- Focused persona (creative economy) with tailored copy and flows.
- AI-ready architecture: rule engine now, ML insertable later.
- Modular monorepo to scale across web, backend, contracts, and shared SDK.

## Success Metrics

- Wallet connections and completed plan generations per week.
- Net deposits into vaults and repeat visits to the portfolio dashboard.
- Judge/mentor feedback on clarity of risk communication.
